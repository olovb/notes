Management Practices
====================

Study showed that 31% of software projects would be canceled before they ever get to the completion stage, and 53% will cost a staggering 189% of their original estimates (Standish Group, 1995).

> "In programming, as in many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve."

Humphrey's law: users will never know what they want until after the system is in production.

Wegner's law: an interactive system can never be fully specified nor fully tested.

Ziv's law: specifications are never fully understood.

> "The first duty of the software engineer is [...] to help the customer understand the nature of their own requirements."

Use code review both to iron out bugs, letting more people know the same code and making developers learn from and support each other.

> "Making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory where the air is full of soot."

Know the difference between intrinsic (for itâ€™s own sake) and extrinsic (carrot or stick) motivation.

> "People will be most creative when they feel motivated primarily by the interest, satisfaction, and challenge of the work itself - not by external pressures." --Amabile, How to Kill Creativity

Set clear goals. Assign clear roles.

Minimize unnecessary distractions.

Match the work to the worker. 

You only make a first impression once. Take good care of new developers right away.

Good project characteristics include:

* available resources (documentation, people),
* continuous feedback,
* clear scope,
* flexibility and
* commitment.

Bad project characteristics include:

* unclear goals,
* hard to see concrete progress and uncertainty,
* moving target, goals changing over time,
* lacking communication and
* reallocations or reprioritizations.

Software development is an "empirical process". (Compare software development to making coffee; stochastic vs deterministic processes.)

Employing inadequate development methods leads to accumulation of technical debt. Technical debt shortens life of a product to as little as 3-8 years.

Technical debt terminology: 

* knowledge silos - only one person can fix a given bug, 
* quality debt - more bugs than you can deal with, 
* general technical debt - poor codebase that makes bugs take longer to fix and 
* test debt - no automated tests so fixes are hard to test.

Developer-customer conversation; must reach consensus regarding what has to be done.

The developer needs to find out how the product owner wants a feature to be. The product owner explains how the feature should work and the developer will make it according to this description.

Talk to all the stakeholders first, then design/implement.

Predicitive vs reactive software development.
