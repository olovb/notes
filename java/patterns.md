Immutable Objects
-----------------

* Don't let subclasses override methods. (Make the class final or make the constructor final and provide factory methods to create instances.)
* Make all fields private and final.
* Defensively copy referenced mutable objects stored within the immutable object, objects that are _passed to its constructors_ or that are _returned from its methods_.
* Provide no methods that can change the object state.


Singleton
---------

### Conventional Approach

* Make the constructor private.
* Store the single instance in a private static volatile field.
* Provide a class method `getInstance()` that returns the singleton instance.

The `getInstance()` method may optionally use __lazy instantiation__, i.e. create the instance on the first call when it hasn't been created as part of the class initialization (e.g. in a class field initializer).


### Enum Approach

A *single element enum* is another way to create a singleton:

    public enum MySingleton {
        INSTANCE;
        â€¦ 
    }
