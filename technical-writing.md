Technical Writing
=================

Be clear on audience and scope of your document.

Define concepts clearly. Always explain, never assume knowledge of concepts unless specifically stated in a prerequisites section or equivalent. Always ask yourself if a term has been properly defined for the reader. Start on a high level of abstraction and drill down. Relate concepts to physical world as early as possible, if possible. 

Start with the general cases first and don’t delve into special cases until necessary.

Define your own vocabulary to promote communication effectiveness. Rather than rehashing the same explanations over and over you should be able to use a clearly defined term.

Prefer using singular nouns when describing concepts. "An order line describes which article…" rather than "order lines describe which articles…" where the latter is less clear (i.e. is there a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship in this specific case)?

Be careful when using abstract vocabulary or when mixing the concrete and abstract worlds in sentences, e.g. what does “picking an order line” or “closing a trip” really mean?

Start writing right away but don’t do premature perfectionization. The understanding will mature and the picture get clearer after you have begun writing things down.

Drilling down too fast creates confusion. Stay at one well defined abstraction level and explore it entirely before drilling down into the different abstract concepts.
